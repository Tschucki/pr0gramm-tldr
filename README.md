## Future Plans

### OCR Text Extraction
The application has future plans to incorporate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract text from images. This will be particularly useful for summarizing comments that do not have a parent comment, allowing the bot to analyze and summarize text content from images, such as those found in Pr0texter posts.
